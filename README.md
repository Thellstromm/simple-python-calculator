 🧮 Simple Python Calculator

A simple and user-friendly command-line calculator written in Python.  
This program allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division — with automatic input validation and clean result formatting.

## 🚀 Features

✅ Supports **addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division**  
✅ Handles **both integers and decimals**  
✅ Includes **error handling** for invalid input or division by zero  
✅ Displays clean results (no unnecessary `.0` at the end)  
✅ Runs in the terminal — lightweight and fast

## 🧠 How It Works

1. The program asks for the **first number**  
2. You choose an **operator** (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`)  
3. Enter the **second number**  
4. The result is displayed in a clear format

### 🧾 Example
Enter first number:
5
Enter operator (+, -, *, /):
*
Enter second number:
3
5 * 3 = 15

💡 Future Improvements

Some ideas for extending the calculator:

Add more mathematical operations (exponent, modulus, square root)

Option to perform multiple calculations in one session

Create a GUI (Graphical User Interface) using Tkinter or PyQt

Add keyboard shortcuts or command-line arguments
